## How to create Test Plan

The above command jmeter will not be run successfull, as jmeter is a desktop application hence if you have GUI on 
linux then you will be able to setup test script in jmeter. 

To avoid below steps and for quick practice, a sample testplan simplilearn.jmx file is added in the repository. This file
can used to run jmeter and publish performance result in jenkins.

To create a script in Jmeter, please refer 
```
- Create a Test plan, provide some appropriate name
- Right click on Test plan in left menu --> Add -> Threads (users) --> Thread Group
- - Add Number of threads as 5 or any your preferred number
  - Loop Count, set to 2
  - Keep other as default 

### Add Http Request for testing
  - Right click on Thread Group --> Add --> Sampler --> HTTP request
	- Add www.simplilearn.com in Server
	- Add the path to different pages in the website simplilearn.com like http://www.simplilearn.com/resources
	- Add multiple requests for different pages in the website, following above 2 steps.

### Setting the results viewer 
	- Right click on Thread Group --> Add --> Listener --> View results in Table
	- Save the test plan
```
